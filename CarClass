        //but how would deg work per lap?
        //OH maybe I can make a baseline and change needsPitstop.
        //Can do like. tireCondition hits a baseline, and it just takes longer to degrade if its hards, instead of having
        //diff tirecondition baselines for tiretypes
        //uh. isnt this the same though? liek if its varying tire condition levels and tire deg is at the same baseline?
        //yeah may as well stick with that. might have to rethink
        //for now, tirecondition baseline/minimum is determining when a pitstop is needed, based off tireType
        //and tireDeg is the same. I kind of want to change it to where tireDeg is different and the min is the same,
        //but the math is confusing me right now.
