    Ok so here id have like:
    Vars: String name, double lapTime, double totalTime, String tireType,
    double tireCondition (where 100 is new and 0 is worn out), int stops
    so if 0 is worn out for hards and lets say 20 is worn for mediums, i guess 40 should be worn out for softs?

   methods would probs be:
   updateLap, needsPitStop, pitStop, getName, getLapTime, getTotalTime, getTireCondition, getPitStops
   should I add setters? Yeah probably if I wanna add user input for tire types..
